# Personal Website Repo

Personal website with GitHub pages. 

## Content

This will be a good place to showcase my hobbies, personal projects, etc.

## Fonts

I really like these fonts, so I'm using them: 
- [Drafting Mono](https://indestructibletype.com/Drafting/)
- [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com)

## JavaScript Usage

I try to use as little JS possible to keep things simple and make sure it loads lightning fast.
