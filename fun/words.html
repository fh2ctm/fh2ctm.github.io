    <h1 id="poems">Poems</h1>
    <p>From Oxford Languages,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A piece of writing that partakes of the nature of both
      speech and song that is nearly always rhythmical, usually
      metaphorical, and often exhibits such formal elements as
      meter, rhyme, and stanzaic structure.</p>

      Love and a cough<br>

      To see a World in a Grain of Sand<br>
      And a Heaven in a Wild Flower<br>
      Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand<br>

    <div class="line-block">
      To see her is a Picture -<br>
      To hear her is a Tune -<br>
      To know her an Intemperance<br>
      As innnocent as June -<br>
      To know her not - Affliction -<br>
      To own her for a friend<br>
      A warmth as near as if the Sun<br>
      Were shining in your Hand.<br>

      Razors pain you;<br>

    <div class="line-block">
      Not a single star will be left in the night.<br>
      The night will not be left.<br>
      I will die and, with me,<br>
      the weight of the intolerable universe.<br>
      I shall erase the pyramids, the medallions,<br>
      the continents and faces.<br>
      I shall erase the accumulated past.<br>
      I shall make dust of history, dust of dust.<br>
      Now I am looking on the final sunset.<br>
      I am hearing the last bird.<br>
      I bequeath nothingness to no one.<br>

      She reads the paper,<br>
      while he turns on TV;<br>

      He’d rather drive,<br>
      she’ll take the plane;<br>
      he waits for sunshine;<br>
      she walks in the rain.<br>

      He gulps down cold drinks,<br>
      she sips at hot;<br>
      he asks, “Why go?”<br>
      She asks, “Why not?”<br>
      <br>
      In just about everything<br>
      they disagree,<br>
      but they love one another<br>
      and they both love me.<br>

    <h1 id="prose">Prose</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Prose is the form of written language that follows the
      natural flow of speech [..] Thus, prose [..] differs most
      notably from <em>poetry</em>.</p>

    <h2 id="as-long-as-there-is-love-there-will-be-grief.">As long
    as there is love, there will be grief.</h2>
    <p>The grief of time passing, of life moving on half-finished,
    of empty spaces that were once bursting with the laughter and
    energy of people we loved.</p>
    <p>As long as there is love there will be grief because grief
    is love’s natural continuation.</p>
    <p>It shows up in the aisles of stores we once frequented, in
    the half-finished bottle of wine we pour out, in the whiff of
    cologne we get two years after they’ve been gone.</p>
    <p>Grief is a giant neon sign, protruding through everything,
    pointing everywhere, broadcasting loudly, “Love was here.”</p>
    <p>In the finer print, quietly, “Love still is.”<br>

    <p>Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant
    never taste of death but once.<br>
