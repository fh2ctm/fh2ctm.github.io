		<h2 id="tab-rant" label="Tabs v Spaces">An Angry Rant on Tabs vs Spaces</h2>

		<p>
			You should never use spaces for indentation.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am writing this angry rant after <code>GHCi</code> had the *audacity*
			to warn me that I'm using tabs inside my source files, and suggested that
			I change them.
		</p>
		<p>
			It just so happens that I was reading an article on the great debate of
			tabs vs spaces yesterday. I am a great advocate of using tabs
			<b>everywhere</b>. 
			You shouldn't even use space to align things
			(why does everyone feel the need to align the <code>=</code>s or
			some other stupid things. You've given up maintainability for some
			minute visual improvement. It's a waste of time.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The main argument that the spaces advocators bring up is that 
			you should use tabs for consistency. 
			Excuse me. 
			How do you get more consistent than just using tabs?
			You know you can set your text editor / IDE to display them as 
			however many spaces you want, right?
		</p>
		<p>
			Some people prefer 2. Some 4. Some 8. 
			Your solution is to sacrifice their preferences for some 
			idiotic notion of "consistency" that can be easily overcome
			by just using the better solution --- tabs. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Tabs are <b>universal</b>. Spaces are not. 
			Spaces are used to align (sure, if you really need to) blocks, and 
			separate tokens. 
			Tabs are for indentation. It always has been and it will forever be the 
			best at it. 
			1 tab = 1 level of indent. Simple. Clean. Effective. Elegant. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We live in a world with others in it, which is a shame, because this 
			means there will forever be something that people will disagree on. 
			I had to respect other people's preferences. 
			But don't you dare force your preference on me. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Rant over. Have a nice day.
