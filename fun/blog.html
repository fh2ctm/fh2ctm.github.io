    <p>Life is not worth living if you have everything you need.
    The easier the struggles come to you, the faster you will find
    meaning. However, not having enough resources to realize your
    potential might be the most devastating thing one could suffer
    from.</p>
    <p>A delicate balance must be striken between hardship and
    potential. An environment too harsh and life will wither and
    die. An environment too accomodating and life will thrive, grow
    without regulation and out of control.</p>
    <p>Humans have something extra special — the ability to form
    and transform thoughts between the abstract and the concrete.
    We call it knowledge. But giving knowledge to a people who
    haven’t lived enough to understand it is no different from
    giving them poison.</p>
