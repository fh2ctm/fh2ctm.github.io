		<p>On this page I recorded all the (interesting) courses I've taken. </p>
		<h1 id="s22">Spring 2022</h1>
		<p>First fun term?</p>
		<h2 id="cs230" label="CS 230">
			CS 230 - Introduction to Computers and Computer Systems
		</h2>
		<p>Assembly was pretty cool.</p>
		<h2 id="cs245" label="CS 245">
			CS 245 - Logic and Computation
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Jonathan Buss</i>.</p>
		<p>Very cool, wish I had spent more time studying it.</p>
		<h2 id="cs371" label="CS 371">
			CS 371 - Intro to Computational Mathematics
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Leili Rafiee Sevyeri</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Only took it because I thought I was going to do CM.
			The couse was very AMATH-y and thus boring to me,
			but I'm surprised how many courses this one led to.
		</p>
		<h2 id="math239" label="MATH 239">
			MATH 239 - Intro to Combinatorics
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Kanstantsin Pashkovich</i>.</p>
		<p>
			My gateway class to C&amp;O.
			I thought: "Finally. This is the kind of math I was expecting".
		</p>
		<h2 id="stat231" label="STAT 231">
			STAT 231 - Statistics
		</h2>
		<p>No comment. Please fix this course.</p>
		<h1 id="F22">Fall 2022</h1>
		<h2 id="cs136l" label="CS 136L">
			CS 136L - Tools and Techniques for Software Development
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Nomair Naeem</i>.</p>
		<p>Useful linux class.</p>
		<h1 id="W23">Winter 2023</h1>
		<h2 id="chem120" label="CHEM 120">
			CHEM 120 - General Chemistry 1
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Germán Sciaini</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Great prof,
			sadly I didn't go to lectures that often.
			Material was easy but some questions on exams were tricky.
		</p>
		<h2 id="co255" label="CO 255">
			CO 255 - Intro to Optimization (Advanced)
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Walaa Moursi</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Interesting course.
			Learning about linear programs and duality is a lot of fun,
			especially considering its wide range of applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			This course also made me realize that I prefer working with discrete things rather than continuous ones.
			The second half of the course was on convex optimization,
			and it felt very PMATH-y, in a bad way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Walla is an amazing prof.
			She talks fast but is very patient when it comes to answering questions and explaining concepts.
		</p>
		<h2 id="cs476" label="CS 476">
			CS 476 - Numerical Methods for Financial Modeling
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Yuying Li</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Apparently a very hard course since the majority of the people had been
			struggling with assignments.
		</p>
		<p>
			A lot of content to go through,
			but the material is interesting and very applicable.
		</p>
		<h2 id="pm331" label="PMATH 331">
			PMATH 331 - Applied Real Analysis
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Ali Abdul Assem</i>.</p>
		<p>
			The "normie" version of other analysis courses (333/351).
			Confirmed that I have no interest with analysis.
		</p>
		<p>
			The prof was very helpful.
			His lectures are very clear and understandable.
			Probably the best lecturing voice I've ever heard.
		</p>
		<h2 id="pm334" label="PMATH 334">
			PMATH 334 - Introduction to Rings and Fields with Applications
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Ethan Kowalenko</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Great experience and assignments were challenging.
			Midterm was hard but I think it's just that I did not prep well.
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't know where Ethan went tho.
			Bro disappeared after teaching the
			course.
		</p>
		<h1 id="s23">Spring 2023</h1>
		<h2 id="ger101" label="GER 101">
			GER 101 - Elementary German 1
		</h2>
		<p>
			We basically have to learn on ourselves based on a book.
			Materials were not easy but manageable given practice.
		</p>
		<h1 id="f23">Fall 2023</h1>
		<h2 id="co330" label="CO 330">
			CO 330 - Combinatorial Enumeration
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Olya Mandelshtam</i>.</p>
		<p>
			A nice extension on <a href="#math239">MATH 239</a>.
			Started with the basics (combinatorial classes) and went all the way to exponential generating functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Didn't have enough time for midterm,
			but over all it was a good experience.
		</p>
		<h2 id="co450" label="CO 450">
			CO 450 - Combinatorial Optimization
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Bill Cook</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Lectures were very fun and relaxing,
			but the assignments were very hard.
			Luckily collaboration is encouraged.
		</p>
		<h2 id="co456" label="CO 456">
			CO 456 - Intro to Game Theory
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Martin Pei</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Martin prepared well for every lecture,
			and were helpful when it comes to answering students' questions.
			However,
			the topic is very new to me and I struggled to solve problems in test.
		</p>
		<h2 id="co485" label="CO 485">
			CO 485 - The Mathematics of Public-Key Cryptography
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">David Jao</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Very mathy cryptography course.
			David freestyled every lecture but it worked well.
			Final project was fun.
		</p>
		<h2 id="korea101r" label="KOREA 101R">
			KOREA 101R - First-Year Korean 1
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Yanggong Kim</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Prof was very passionate in teaching and responsible to students.
			Course staff put in a lot of effort to ensure we are given enough practice (verbal and writing).
		</p>
		<h1 id="w24">Winter 2024</h1>
		<h2 id="co331" label="CO 331">
			CO 331 - Coding Theory
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Alfred Menezes</i>.</p>
		<p>
			The perfect online course.
			The course material haven't changed in a decade, because it works perfectly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The course is all about very nice algebraic results and their applications.
			Great experience.
		</p>
		<h2 id="co430" label="CO 430">
			CO 430 - Algebraic Enumeration
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">David Wagner</i>.</p>
		<blockquote>
			Be nice to him, he's kind of a character.
			<cite><i>David Jao</i>, CO Undergrad Officer</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I enjoyed the course a lot. Considering my interest in enumerative combinatorics,
			this isn't a surprise.
		</p>
		<p>Some topics covered:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Exponential generating functions</li>
			<li>Pólya theory</li>
			<li>
				Representation of Lie algebra
				<span class="math">\(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\)</span>
			</li>
			<li>Plane partitions</li>
			<li>Pfaffian and graph orientations</li>
			<li>Matrix-tree theorem</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="co481" label="CO 481">
			CO 481 - Intro to Quantum Info and Processing
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Michele Mosca</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Very fun.
			Quantum info is entirely new for me and it was exciting to learn about it.
			The prof talks kinda vague sometimes but will happily clarify any questions students may have.
		</p>
		<p>
			The course also had amazing TAs.
			They helped me a lot with the assignments.
		</p>
		<p>
			The last few lectures for the course were guest speakers working with quantum information and quantum physics who came and spoke about the current cutting-edge stuff,
			including
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quantum error-correcting codes</li>
			<li>Quantum compiler</li>
			<li>Ion-trap implementation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I'm by no means a physicist or an expert in the field so there might be
			some mistakes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, 10/10 course.
			Would recommend to anyone.
		</p>
		<h2 id="comm101" label="COMM 101">
			COMM 101 - Intro to Financial Markets
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Peter Blake</i>.</p>
		<p>
			Horrible course.
			The material was fine I guess, but the instructors and TAs have been ghosting students for the <i>entire</i> term.
			Learn discussion questions went <b>months</b> without reply.
		</p>
		<p>Wasn't a bird either. Not recommended.</p>
		<h1 id="s24">Spring 2024</h1>
		<h2 id="co739" label="CO 739">
			CO 739 - Proof Formalization
		</h2>
		<p>Taught by <i class="instructor">Peter Nelson</i>.</p>
		<p>
			This is a brand new course which attracted a lot of attention from students across different math majors.
			Unfortunately,
			I had to drop it because when I was trying to do the exercises,
			it felt like someone was grating my brain with a cheese grater.
