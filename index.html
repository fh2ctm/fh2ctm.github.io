  <h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>
  <p>Testing out my new website. This is a very very very very very very very very very very long sentence so I can be very very very very very very very very sure that things are working. </p>

  <p>
    My name is Rex. I know, very cool name. I am studying <a href="https://slither.io">math</a> at <a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>. 
    I made this website for fun, of course. Nothing here look serious.
