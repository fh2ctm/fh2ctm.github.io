      I like collecting pens.
      They are maybe my favourite kind of tool since they can be made with such excellent craftmanship that you could display them,
      while also being vastly practical.

    <h1 id="Fountain Pens">Fountain Pens</h1>
    <p>
      Less people are using fountain pens now due to ballpoints and needles being cheaper and easier to obtain.
      However,
      buying a pen and throwing it away after it's done doesn't seem very environmentally friendly to me.
      Even if you can get a replacement cartridge,
      it's still a lot of plastic.

      I got into fountain pens when I first visited a Lamy store and tried out a Lamy Safari.
      I was surprised at how well-built and smooth it is compared to the junk pens I used in elementary school.
      Without much thinking, I got one, and it has been a pleasure to use ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current collection, in chronological order of acquisition:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lamy Al-Star, F, Black</li>
      <li>Lamy LX, F, Silver</li>
      <li>Lamy 2000, F</li>
      <li>Muji Fountain Pen, F</li>
      <li>Faber-Castell Loom, EF, White</li>
      <li>OPUS 88 Demonstrator, EF</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="L2K">Lamy 2000</h2>
    <p>
      This has been the "grail pen" of many in the fountain pen community.
      And for good reasons.
      Its design is timless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although, one common complaint is that the nib size is inaccurate --- some people said their EF writes like an M.
      Apparently this is a common thing that happens with Lamy QA,
      but the nib write wet and smoothly,
      so can't complain.

      Pencils are good in that you can erase your writing easily,
      but the writing experience is, in my opinion, not on par with regular pens.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, they are preferred when writing exams for obvious reasons.

      I currently use a blue <em>Uni Kuru-Toga Advance</em> and it works great.
