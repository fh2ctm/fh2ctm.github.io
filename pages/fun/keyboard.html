    <p>Keyboards that I use or have used.</p>
    <h1 id="Prebuilt">Prebuilt</h1>
    <p>
      Keyboards that you use out of the box instead of customizing.

      Nice little board.
      Battery life is great and haven't had any connectivity issues with it.
      Unfortunately one of the keys died after a drop,
      and didn't find a way to disassemble to fix it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Hybrid Type-S">HHKB Hybrid Type-S</h2>
    <p>
      A simple Topre board.
      Many people's grail.

      I owned one of these in snow white with blank keycaps.
      It looked <em>amazing</em>.
      However,
      I did not like the typing experience as some have.
      That and I wasn't able to customize the key layout to my liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sold for a good price.
      I really wish I had liked it more.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Logi K780">Logitech K780</h2>
    <p>
      I <em>really</em> like the design of this keyboard.
      As for typing experience, nothing amazing.
    </p>
    <h1 id="Custom">Custom</h1>
    <p>
      Keyboards that you customize.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Keychron Q3">Keychron Q3</h2>
    <p>
      My first custom keyboard.
      Build quality's solid, but the paint job is kinda bad.
      Did some tape mod, added foam, dampeners, and spray painted black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sold eventually due to the height feeling wrong.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Drop CSTM65">Drop CSTM65</h2>
    <p>
      Current use.
      Solid build, IMO the nicest shine-through keycaps you can get.
