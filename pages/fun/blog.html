      I was going to maintain a blog here,
      but I might not be professional for that.

    <p>
      I was happy with using my walkman,
      but I started to get ear infections from wearing the IEMs for too long :(
      I find myself missing the over-ears and the DAC on my desk,
      but unfortunately I cannot carry them with me.
    </p>

      Managing library is another headache...
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless_Audio_Codec">ALAC</a>
      is a lot better FLAC with better metadata support <b>and</b> it's the only modern lossless format that the Apple
      Music app on my MacBook supports.
      I'd use it everywhere,
      except all the sources I can get are FLACs,
      which means I have to download them,
      convert them to ALACs,
      load them onto my Walkman,
      and load them into my Apple Music library on my Mac.
    </p>

      If it were an iPod,
      I'd still be able to just sync it,
      which would've been so much better!
      Sadly we will never have a new iPod again :(
