    <p>How I listen to music.</p>
    <h1 id="Source">Source</h1>
    Where I get my music from.
    <h2 id="Streaming">Streaming</h2>
    <p>
      I use Apple Music because I use Apple mobile devices,
      and I marginally prefer its UI over Spotify.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that there are other streaming services, such as Tidal, Geezer, YouTube music, et cetera.
      I have tried most of them and although there weren't obvious downsides with them, Apple Music and Spotify are the
      mainstream options.
      This means new songs will likely be released on these platforms first.
      Moreover, they just have better platform support.
      Going with them seems the easy choice.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Files">Digital Files</h2>
    <p>
      I collect MP3s and FLACs from the internet.
      I prefer to purchase them on <a href="https://ca.7digital.com/">7digital</a> when they are available.
      When they are not, I download audio from YouTube videos.
    </p>
    <h1 id="Setup">Setup</h1>
    <p>
      I have DACs, headphones, DAPs and IEMs.
      Here is a list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Topping DX3 pro+</li>
      <li>Beyerdynamics DT 990 Edition</li>
      <li>AKG K702</li>
      <li>Sony NW-A45</li>
      <li>Apple Earpods</li>
      <li>Sennheiser IE 200</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For now,
      my most common setup is using A45 with IE 200.
      When I'm at home,
      <s>I use A45 to stream to the DAC and listen with the DT 990s</s>
      I went back to Apple Music so I can use my MacBook directly as digital source.
