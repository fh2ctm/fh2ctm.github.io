		<h1 id="cs230">
			CS 230 - Introduction to Computers and Computer Systems
		</h1>
		<p>Assembly was pretty cool.</p>

		<h1 id="cs245">CS 245 - Logic and Computation</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Jonathan Buss</em>.</p>
		<p>Very cool, wish I had spent more time studying it.</p>

		<h1 id="cs371">CS 371 - Intro to Computational Mathematics</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Leili Rafiee Sevyeri</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Only took it because I thought I was going to do CM. The couse was very
			AMATH-y and thus boring to me, but I'm surprised how many courses this
			one led to.
		</p>

		<h1 id="math239">MATH 239 - Intro to Combinatorics</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Kanstantsin Pashkovich</em>.</p>
		<p>
			My gateway class to C&O. I thought: "Finally. This is the kind of math I
			was expecting".
		</p>

		<h1 id="stat231">STAT 231 - Statistics</h1>
		<p>No comment. Please fix this course.</p>

		<!-- Fall 2022 -->

		<h1 id="cs136l">
			CS 136L - Tools and Techniques for Software Development
		</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Nomair Naeem</em>.</p>
		<p>Useful linux class.</p>

		<!-- Winter 2023 -->

		<h1 id="chem120">CHEM 120 - General Chemistry 1</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Germán Sciaini</em>.</p>
		<p>Great prof, sadly I didn't go to lectures that often.</p>
		<p>Material was easy but some questions on exams were tricky.</p>

		<h1 id="co255">CO 255 - Intro to Optimization (Advanced)</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Walaa Moursi</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Interesting course. Learning about linear programs and duality is a lot
			of fun, especially considering its wide range of applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			This course also made me realize that I prefer working with discrete
			things rather than continuous ones. The second half of the course was on
			convex optimization, and it felt very PMATH-y, in a bad way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Walla is an amazing prof. She talks fast but is very patient when it
			comes to answering questions and explaining concepts.
		</p>

		<h1 id="cs476">CS 476 - Numerical Methods for Financial Modeling</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Yuying Li</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Apparently a very hard course since the majority of the people had been
			struggling with assignments.
		</p>
		<p>
			A lot of content to go through, but the material is interest and very
			applicable.
		</p>

		<h1 id="pmath331">PMATH 331 - Applied Real Analysis</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Ali Abdul Assem</em>.</p>
		<p>
			The "normie" version of other analysis courses (333/351). Confirmed that
			I have no interest with analysis.
		</p>
		<p>
			The prof was very helpful. His lectures are very clear and
			understandable. Probably the best lecturing voice I've ever heard.
		</p>

		<h1 id="pmath334">
			PMATH 334 - Introduction to Rings and Fields with Applications
		</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Ethan Kowalenko</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Great experience and assignments were challenging. Midterm was hard but
			I think it's just that I did not prep well.
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't know where Ethan went tho. Bro disappeared after teaching the
			course.
		</p>

		<!-- Spring 2023 -->

		<h1 id="ger101">GER 101 - Elementary German 1</h1>
		<p>We basically have to learn on ourselves based on a book.</p>
		<p>Materials were not easy but manageable given practice.</p>

		<!-- Fall 2023 -->

		<h1 id="co330">CO 330 - Combinatorial Enumeration</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Olya Mandelshtam</em>.</p>
		<p>
			A nice extension on <a href="#math239">MATH 239</a>. Started with the
			basics (combinatorial classes) and went all the way to exponential
			generating functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Didn't have enough time for midterm, but over all it was a good
			experience.
		</p>

		<h1 id="co450">CO 450 - Combinatorial Optimization</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Bill Cook</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Lectures were very fun and relaxing, but the assignments were very hard.
			Luckily collaboration is encouraged.
		</p>

		<h1 id="co456">CO 456 - Intro to Game Theory</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Martin Pei</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Martin prepared well for every lecture, and were helpful when it comes
			to answering students' questions. However, the topic is very new to me
			and I struggled to solve problems in test.
		</p>
		<p>It wasn't fun for me, but I'm sure it was for someone else.</p>

		<h1 id="co485">CO 485 - The Mathematics of Public-Key Cryptography</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">David Jao</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Very mathy cryptography course. David freestyled every lecture but it
			worked well.
		</p>
		<p>Final project was fun.</p>

		<h1 id="korea101r">KOREA 101R - First-Year Korean 1</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Yanggong Kim</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Prof was very passionate in teaching and responsible to students. Course
			staff put in a lot of effort to ensure we are given enough practice
			(verbal and writing).
		</p>

		<!-- Winter 2024 -->

		<h1 id="co331">CO 331 - Coding Theory</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Alfred Menezes</em>.</p>
		<p>
			The perfect online course. The course material haven't changed in a
			decade, because it works perfectly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The course is all about very nice algebraic results and their
			applications. Great experience.
		</p>

		<h1 id="co430">CO 430 - Algebraic Enumeration</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">David Wagner</em>.</p>
		<blockquote>
			Be nice to him, he's kind of a character. &mdash;&mdash; David Jao, CO
			Undergrad Officer
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I enjoyed the course a lot. Considering my interest in enumerative
			combinatorics, this isn't a surprise.
		</p>
		<p>Some topics covered:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Exponential generating functions</li>
			<li>Pólya theory</li>
			<li>
				Representation of Lie algebra
				<span class="math">\(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\)</span>
			</li>
			<li>Plane partitions</li>
			<li>Pfaffian and graph orientations</li>
			<li>Matrix-tree theorem</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			David has since retired, making this offering the last course he's ever
			taught. It was a pleasure to be a part of it.
		</p>

		<h1 id="co481">CO 481 - Intro to Quantum Info and Processing</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Michele Mosca</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Very fun. Quantum info is entirely new for me and it was exciting to
			learn about it. The prof is a seasoned professional in
			<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">IQC</a>.
			He talks kinda vague sometimes but will happily clarify any questions
			students may have.
		</p>
		<p>
			The course also had amazing TAs. They helped me a lot with the
			assignments.
		</p>
		<p>
			The last few lectures for the course were guest speakers working with
			quantum information and quantum physics who came and spoke about the
			current cutting-edge stuff, including
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quantum error-correcting codes</li>
			<li>Quantum compiler</li>
			<li>Ion-trap implementation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I'm by no means a physicist or an expert in the field so there might be
			some mistakes.
		</p>
		<p>Overall, 10/10 course. Would recommend to anyone.</p>

		<h1 id="comm101">COMM 101 - Intro to Financial Markets</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Peter Blake</em>.</p>
		<p>
			Horrible course. The material was fine I guess, but the instructors and
			TAs have been ghosting students for the
			<em>entire</em> term. Learn discussion questions went
			<b>months</b> without reply.
		</p>
		<p>Wasn't a bird either. Not recommended.</p>

		<!-- Spring 2024 -->

		<h1 id="co739">CO 739 - Proof Formalization</h1>
		<p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Peter Nelson</em>.</p>
		<p>
			This is a brand new course which attracted a lot of attention from
			students across different math majors.
