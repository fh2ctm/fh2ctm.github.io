  <h1 id="co255">CO 255 - Intro to Optimization (Advanced)</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Walaa Moursi</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Interesting course. Learning about linear programs and duality is a lot of fun, especially considering its wide range of applications. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This course also made me realize that I prefer working with discrete things rather than continuous ones. The second half of the course was on convex optimization, and it felt very PMATH-y, in a bad way. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Walla is an amazing prof. She talks fast but is very patient when it comes to answering questions and explaining concepts. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co331">CO 331 - Coding Theory</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Alfred Menezes</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The perfect online course. The course material haven't changed in a decade, because it works perfectly. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The course is all about very nice algebraic results and their applications. Great experience. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="cs476">CS 476 - Numerical Methods for Financial Modeling</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Yuying Li</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Apparently a very hard course since the majority of the people had been struggling with assignments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of content to go through, but the material is interest and very applicable. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="pmath331">PMATH 331 - Applied Real Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Ali Abdul Assem</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The "normie" version of other analysis courses (333/351). 
    Confirmed that I have no interest with analysis. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The prof was very helpful. His lectures are very clear and understandable. Probably the best lecturing voice I've ever heard. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co430">CO 430 - Algebraic Enumeration</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">David Wagner</em>. 
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Be nice to him, he's kind of a character. &mdash;&mdash; David Jao, CO Undergrad Officer
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I enjoyed the course a lot. Considering my interest in enumerative combinatorics, this isn't a surprise. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Some topics covered:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exponential generating functions
      </li>
      <li>
        PÃ³lya theory
      </li>
      <li>
       Representation of Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\)
      </li>
      <li>
        Plane partitions
      </li>
      <li>
        Pfaffian and graph orientations
      </li>
      <li>
        Matrix-tree theorem
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    David has since retired, making this offering the last course he's ever taught. It was a pleasure to be a part of it. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co481">CO 481 - Intro to Quantum Info and Processing</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Michele Mosca</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Very fun. Quantum info is entirely new for me and it was exciting to learn about it. 
    The prof is a seasoned professional in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">IQC</a>. He talks kinda vague sometimes but will happily clarify any questions students may have. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The course also had amazing TAs. They helped me a lot with the assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last few lectures for the course were guest speakers working with quantum information and quantum physics who came and spoke about the current cutting-edge stuff, including 
    <ul>
      <li>Quantum error-correcting codes</li>
      <li>Quantum compiler</li>
      <li>Ion-trap implementation</li>
    </ul>
    I'm by no means a physicist or an expert in the field so there might be some mistakes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, 10/10 course. Would recommend to anyone. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="comm101">COMM 101 - Intro to Financial Markets</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Peter Blake</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Horrible course. The material was fine I guess, but the instructors and TAs have been ghosting students for the <em>entire</em> term. 
    Learn discussion questions went <b>months</b> without reply. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Wasn't a bird either. Not recommended. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co739">CO 739 - Proof Formalization</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Peter Nelson</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a brand new course which attracted a lot of attention from students across different math majors.
