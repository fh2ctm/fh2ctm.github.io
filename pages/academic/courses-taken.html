  <h1 id="cs230">CS 230 - Introduction to Computers and Computer Systems</h1>
  <p>Assembly was pretty cool. </p>

  <h1 id="cs245">CS 245 - Logic and Computation</h1>
  <p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Jonathan Buss</em>.</p>
  <p>
    Very cool, wish I had spent more time studying it. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="cs371">CS 371 - Intro to Computational Mathematics</h1>
  <p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Leili Rafiee Sevyeri</em>.</p>
  <p>
    Only took it because I thought I was going to do CM. The couse was very AMATH-y and thus boring to me, but I'm surprised how many courses this one led to. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="math239">MATH 239 - Intro to Combinatorics</h1>
  <p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Kanstantsin Pashkovich</em>.</p>
  <p>
    My gateway class to C&O. I thought: "Finally. This is the kind of math I was expecting". 
  </p>

  <h1 id="stat231">STAT 231 - Statistics</h1>
  <p>
    No comment. Please fix this course. 
  </p>

  <!-- Fall 2022 -->

  <h1 id="cs136l">CS 136L - Tools and Techniques for Software Development</h1>
  <p>Taught by <em class="instructor">Nomair Naeem</em>.</p>
  <p>Useful linux class. </p>

  <!-- Winter 2023 -->

  <h1 id="chem120">CHEM 120 - General Chemistry 1</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Germán Sciaini</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Great prof, sadly I didn't go to lectures that often. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Material was easy but some questions on exams were tricky. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co255">CO 255 - Intro to Optimization (Advanced)</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Walaa Moursi</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Interesting course. Learning about linear programs and duality is a lot of fun, especially considering its wide range of applications. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This course also made me realize that I prefer working with discrete things rather than continuous ones. The second half of the course was on convex optimization, and it felt very PMATH-y, in a bad way. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Walla is an amazing prof. She talks fast but is very patient when it comes to answering questions and explaining concepts. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="cs476">CS 476 - Numerical Methods for Financial Modeling</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Yuying Li</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Apparently a very hard course since the majority of the people had been struggling with assignments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of content to go through, but the material is interest and very applicable. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="pmath331">PMATH 331 - Applied Real Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Ali Abdul Assem</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The "normie" version of other analysis courses (333/351). 
    Confirmed that I have no interest with analysis. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The prof was very helpful. His lectures are very clear and understandable. Probably the best lecturing voice I've ever heard. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="pmath334">PMATH 334 - Introduction to Rings and Fields with Applications</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Ethan Kowalenko</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Great experience and assignments were challenging. Midterm was hard but I think it's just that I did not prep well. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't know where Ethan went tho. Bro disappeared after teaching the course. 
  </p>

  <!-- Spring 2023 -->

  <h1 id="ger101">GER 101 - Elementary German 1</h1>
  <p>
    We basically have to learn on ourselves based on a book. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Materials were not easy but manageable given practice. 
  </p>

  <!-- Fall 2023 -->

  <h1 id="co330">CO 330 - Combinatorial Enumeration</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Olya Mandelshtam</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A nice extension on <a href="#math239">MATH 239</a>. Started with the basics (combinatorial classes) and went all the way to exponential generating functions. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Didn't have enough time for midterm, but over all it was a good experience. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co450">CO 450 - Combinatorial Optimization</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Bill Cook</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lectures were very fun and relaxing, but the assignments were very hard. Luckily collaboration is encouraged. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co456">CO 456 - Intro to Game Theory</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Martin Pei</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Martin prepared well for every lecture, and were helpful when it comes to answering students' questions. However, the topic is very new to me and I struggled to solve problems in test. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It wasn't fun for me, but I'm sure it was for someone else. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co485">CO 485 - The Mathematics of Public-Key Cryptography</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">David Jao</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Very mathy cryptography course. David freestyled every lecture but it worked well. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Final project was fun. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="korea101r">KOREA 101R - First-Year Korean 1</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Yanggong Kim</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prof was very passionate in teaching and responsible to students. Course staff put in a lot of effort to ensure we are given enough practice (verbal and writing). 
  </p>

  <!-- Winter 2024 -->

  <h1 id="co331">CO 331 - Coding Theory</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Alfred Menezes</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The perfect online course. The course material haven't changed in a decade, because it works perfectly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The course is all about very nice algebraic results and their applications. Great experience.
  </p>

  <h1 id="co430">CO 430 - Algebraic Enumeration</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">David Wagner</em>. 
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Be nice to him, he's kind of a character. &mdash;&mdash; David Jao, CO Undergrad Officer
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I enjoyed the course a lot. Considering my interest in enumerative combinatorics, this isn't a surprise. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Some topics covered:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exponential generating functions
      </li>
      <li>
        Pólya theory
      </li>
      <li>
       Representation of Lie algebra <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\)</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Plane partitions
      </li>
      <li>
        Pfaffian and graph orientations
      </li>
      <li>
        Matrix-tree theorem
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    David has since retired, making this offering the last course he's ever taught. It was a pleasure to be a part of it. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="co481">CO 481 - Intro to Quantum Info and Processing</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Michele Mosca</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Very fun. Quantum info is entirely new for me and it was exciting to learn about it. 
    The prof is a seasoned professional in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">IQC</a>. He talks kinda vague sometimes but will happily clarify any questions students may have. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The course also had amazing TAs. They helped me a lot with the assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last few lectures for the course were guest speakers working with quantum information and quantum physics who came and spoke about the current cutting-edge stuff, including 
    <ul>
      <li>Quantum error-correcting codes</li>
      <li>Quantum compiler</li>
      <li>Ion-trap implementation</li>
    </ul>
    I'm by no means a physicist or an expert in the field so there might be some mistakes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, 10/10 course. Would recommend to anyone. 
  </p>

  <h1 id="comm101">COMM 101 - Intro to Financial Markets</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Peter Blake</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Horrible course. The material was fine I guess, but the instructors and TAs have been ghosting students for the <em>entire</em> term. 
    Learn discussion questions went <b>months</b> without reply. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Wasn't a bird either. Not recommended. 
  </p>

  <!-- Spring 2024 -->

  <h1 id="co739">CO 739 - Proof Formalization</h1>
  <p>
    Taught by <em class="instructor">Peter Nelson</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a brand new course which attracted a lot of attention from students across different math majors. 
  </p>
